Despite many historical failures, this strategy has come to fruition for drug developers in recent years with the entry of the first DMTs to the market. The FDA approved Eisai/Biogen\u2019s Leqembi (lecanemab) in January 2023 and Lilly\u2019s Kisunla (donanemab) in July 2024, and both drugs have since been approved in Japan, China and the UK.
